Changes for myForecast 1.0.2
============================
Enhancements
- Centered the whole layout.
- Cleaned up the temperature data on the screen. Now it also shows the correct unit - °F/°C.
  Removed the decimal point for the current condition temperature.
- The left daily forecast tile now shows the current day forecast (2 hours ahead of the current time).
- Added support for hourly forecast. You can now navigate to the current weather condition panel
  when selected it acts as a button. When clicked it hides the daily forecast data and shows
  the hourly forecast weather data (36 hours ahead). You can use the left/right button on the remote
  control to scroll thru the data. To go back to the default layout just click again on the current
  weather condition panel. The scheduled data refresh will also restore the default layout.
